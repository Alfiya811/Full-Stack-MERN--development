CSS Animation 
Animation in CSS has three major concepts:-
1.tranforms
2.transitions
3.keyframes

1]Tranforms 
Change HTML element in 2D-plane
move from one position to other ,resizing ,rotations, streching.
  i)rotations
 ii)Scale
iii)Skew
 iv)Translate

 *Translate*
 Move in X and Y axis ,change the position of HTML element

 *Rotate*
 Roatate in 3D value indegree is given as value 
   rotateX
   rotateY
   rotateZ
   roatate= in 2D plane,both X and Y rotate
   rotate3d= X ,Y and Z

 *Scale*
 Resize element,make it bigger or smaller
 scaleX
 scaleY
 scaleZ
 scale3d

 *Skew*
 Tilt or stretch element in X and Y axis  

Matrix
To combine all the tranformation property together we can use matrix as
 tranformation:matrix(scaleX,scaleY,skewX,skewY,translateX,translateY);

2]Transitions
If Changes are happening on webpage then CSS is used to make the transition appear smooth,tehn transition are used.

transition-property
 We can select which property transition we are targeting

tansition-duration
 How much time is taken to complete the transition 

 transition-delay
 defines a specific time after which the transition affect should be applied

 transition-timing-function
 Helps to decide how transition properties change during a transition
   ease=Start slow end slow and faster in middle
   linear=same speed throughout
   ease-in=Starts slow ,ends very fast
   ease-out=Start Fast ,ends very slow
   steps-end=specify the transition with a constant begining that ends instantly
   cubic-biezer 

transition:transition-property transition-duration transition-timing-function transition-delay

3]Keyframe
 It is a keyword 
 @keyframes

 CSS rules
 Keyframes are defined in percentage,these percentage shows the part of animation execution time.
0% start of animation 100% at the end of it.


@keyframes name{
    0%{
        background-color:orange;
    }
    10%{
        background-color:lightblue;
    }
    80%{
        ...
    }
}
1.animation-delay
 The animation-delay property specifies the delay in time before the animation starts.
 Representated in sec or milisec 

2.Animation name
 This property is used to set name to animation and use it to create keyframe.
 Keyframes contains the change in CSS that should happen when an animation is triggered.

3.animation iteration count 
 Defines the number of time animation  needs to continue,we can define this count in terms of once or infinite.

4.Animation direction
This specifies the direction in which keyframes change the need to execute in animation,The normal execution flow takes the changes from 0-100
in Reverse keyframes will execute from 100 to 0

Reverse
alternate
Reverse
alternate
normal
alternate-reverse

5.Animation timing function
 This specifies how the transition should sail throuhout it's execution span.it is very similar to that of transition-timing-function

6.Animation property
 Shorthand everything together

 animation:animation-name animation-duration animation-timing-function animation-delay animation-iteration-count
