#CSS Flex/Flexbox
*Flex is designed for one-dimensional layouts for 1-axis, meaning it works well for arranging items in a row or column.It’s ideal for aligning items within a container.
*Flexbox is used for simpler layouts where you need to align items in a single direction (either horizontally or vertically). It's great for things like navigation bars, toolbars, or simple item lists.
ex:-
body{
   display: flex ;
   }

#CSS Grid 
*CSS Grid is used usually for two-dimensional layouts, handling both rows and columns simultaneously. It’s great for creating complex grid-based layouts, with precise control over the placement and sizing of items across both axes.
*Grid is used for more complex layouts where you need control over both rows and columns. It’s ideal for building entire page layouts, like grids of cards, magazine-style layouts, or dashboard interfaces.
ex:-
body{
   display: flex ;
   }
